## Lecture Notes

I type my lecture notes using VSCode in [LaTeX-Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop). I use the [HyperSnips](https://github.com/Oskar-Idland/hsnips) extension to create snippets that lets me type lecture notes fast. I use the [GlassIt](https://github.com/hikarin522/GlassIt-VSC) extension to make my editor transparent, as I believe the editor looks more beautiful that way.

You can see a demo here:

My setup was inspired by [sleepymalc](https://github.com/sleepymalc/VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape/tree/main).
