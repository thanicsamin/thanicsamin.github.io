  I'm a second-year PhD student at Indiana University in Bloomington, where I'm part of [Matthias Strauch](https://mstrauch.pages.iu.edu)'s Number Theory group. I earned my undergraduate degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, working under the guidance of [Ivan Chi-Ho Ip](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~ivanip/). Prior to that, I briefly studied Electrical Engineering at Dhaka University.

  My interests span across various areas of mathematics, with my current focus on Algebraic Number Theory. I'm also pursuing a minor in Partial Differential Equations.

  I type my lecture notes using LaTeX directly in class. The lecture notes are publicly available [here](/lecture-notes/).

  As a former competitive programmer with the Dhaka University team, [DU_FlareBlitz](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1171488216349870&set=a.146688232163212), I have a strong background in C++. I'm passionate about programming and enjoy creating mathematical animations using the Manim library in Python. I'm proficient in SageMath and am currently learning Rust, drawn to its promise of memory safety.

  I have a deep appreciation for math olympiads. I used to participate in Math Olympiads when I was in high school, and after my graduation I was involved with training students. I believe olympiads are a fun and exciting way to get started with mathematics.
