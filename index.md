I'm a second-year PhD student in Number Theory at Indiana University in Bloomington, where I'm part of Matthias Strauch's Number Theory group. I earned my undergraduate degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, working under the guidance of Professor Ivan Chi Ho Ip. Prior to that, I briefly studied Electrical Engineering at Dhaka University.

My interests span across various areas of mathematics, with my current focus on Algebraic Number Theory. I'm also pursuing a minor in Partial Differential Equations.

As a former competitive programmer with the Dhaka University team, DU FlareBlitz, I have a strong background in C++. I'm passionate about programming and enjoy creating mathematical animations using the Manim library in Python. I'm proficient in SageMath and am currently learning Rust, drawn to its promise of memory safety.

I have a deep appreciation for math olympiads. My high school achievements include a bronze medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad and a silver medal at the Asia Pacific Mathematics Olympiad. I was also the First Runner-Up in the HKUST Annual Math Competition (Senior Division).
